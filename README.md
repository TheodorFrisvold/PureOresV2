# PureOresV2
Adds rare 'pure' versions of ore to the game

All sources of ore, gems or crystals can now drop a rare 'pure' version of itself. The chance can be defined individually or with a global variable.
It's possible to add more drops from blocks. 

On the TODO list is adding support for entities.
